Here you will get various guides related to **Machine Learning** that will help you understand the concepts better.

Currently, you can read the [guide](https://read.quantml.org/la/) for **Linear Algebra**. 
I recommended you to take the [18.06sc](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/) course and my [guide](https://read.quantml.org/la/) parallelly.

Guide for **Statistics** is coming soon, and there are plans for the guides of **Machine Learning** and Reinforcement Learning
